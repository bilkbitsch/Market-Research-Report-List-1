<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IOL Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preloaded IOL Delivery Systems</li><li>Non-Preloaded IOL Delivery Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IOL delivery systems market is categorized into preloaded and non-preloaded systems. Preloaded IOL delivery systems come with the intraocular lens (IOL) already positioned within the injector, streamlining the surgical procedure and reducing the risk of contamination. Conversely, non-preloaded IOL delivery systems require surgeons to load the IOL into the injector before use, offering greater flexibility in lens selection but potentially increasing procedural complexity. Both types are critical in facilitating accurate and efficient cataract surgeries.</p></p>
