<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Frame Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Valve</li><li>Biological Tissue Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve frame market primarily consists of two types: mechanical valves and biological tissue valves. Mechanical valves are made from durable materials like carbon and metal, offering long-lasting performance but requiring lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent blood clots. In contrast, biological tissue valves, derived from animal tissue, provide a more natural hemodynamic profile and usually do not necessitate long-term anticoagulation, though they may have a shorter lifespan. Each type caters to different patient needs and surgical considerations.</p></p>
