<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Inkjet Printhead Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial inkjet printhead market is primarily divided into two types: piezoelectric and thermal. Piezoelectric printheads utilize electrical impulses to deform piezoelements, ejecting ink droplets with high precision. This technology offers versatility in ink types and better control over droplet size, making it ideal for high-quality printing applications. In contrast, thermal printheads heat ink to create vapor bubbles, forcing droplets out. While generally more cost-effective, they may be limited in ink compatibility. Both types cater to diverse printing needs in various industries.</p></p>
